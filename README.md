Hi, my name is Lucas Elroy. 
I graduated with an Electrical and Computer Engineering degree at the University of Washington in June of 2024. 
I am interested in audio engineering, HDL design, VLSI and analog circuit design. 
I am always looking for cool projects and ways to learn new skills.
This account will detail projects I am passionate about that I have completed or am currently working on.
